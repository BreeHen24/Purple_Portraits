		<p>
		<b>Francis Tuttle Graphic Communications </b>students work with the <b>Child Development Center</b> and the <b>Pre-K classes</b> to have a
		live-work opportunity for students and produce pictures.
		</p>
			
		<p>
		Students work with a photographer, build a set, work with lightning and take of photos of the child-care and pre-k students.<br>
		
		Then students use their photoshop knowledge to be sure the photos are print ready. Parents have an opportunity to purchase the prints once editing
		<br>is complete, students learn the ordering software and we order prints through an exceptional photography printer.
		</p>
			
		<p>All proceeds go to our student organization, fund, Business Professionals of America</p>
			
		<p>Thank you for supporting students!</p>
			
		<p><b>Parent Experience:</b></p>
			
		<p>Francis Tuttle students strive to give parents a high-quality service and product at a fraction of the cost leading school photography companies.</p>

		<p>Our Students strive to build a set that is appealing following current trends and take time and care with each subject, attempting to get the <br>perfect photo, while watching intently to details to ensure a good photograph.</p>
